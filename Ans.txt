Q1=> Give an example where call apply bind is. required?
Ans=> The call() and apply() are very similar methods. They both execute the bound function on the object immediately. 
      The bind() method does not execute the function right away. Instead, it creates and returns a bound function that can be executed later.

Q2=> What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
Ans=> readFileSync() is synchronous and blocks execution until finished. These return their results as return values. readFile() are asynchronous 
      and return immediately while they function in the background.

Ans=> inbuilt -> var str = "Raghav"
                 var res = str.split().reverse().join("")
      iteratively -> var bag=""

                for(var i = str.length-1 ; i>=0 ; i--){
                  bag+=str[i]
                 }
                console.log(bag)

Q7=> what is shallow equal?
